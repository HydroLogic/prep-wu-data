            <h2 id="thestory" class="graphicalheading"><span>The Story</span></h2>          <div class="overview">              <p>In 1971 the Who was the most ambitious band in the world. They&rsquo;d just put out the first major rock opera &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo;; and for a followup they were planning something called &ldquo;Lifehouse&rdquo;&mdash;a massive multimedia project that would involve a concept album, live performances with actors, and a fantasy computer system that sounded a whole lot like the Internet.</p>              <p>Guitarist/composer Pete Townshend spent months developing the project, which got more grandiose as it went along: He even planned a series of Who concerts where the personalities of the audience members would be fed into a computer to generate music. Finally Townshend buckled under pressure and scrapped the project, using many of the songs on the album <em>Who&rsquo;s Next</em>.</p>              <p>Originally planned as a big moment in <em>Lifehouse</em>, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Get Fooled Again&rdquo; held up just fine as an epic album track&mdash;Apparently, the keyboard break at the end is a stand-in for the planned computer music. Tell us if you can solve the mystery of the lyrics: Is Townshend endorsing revolutionary politics or denouncing them?</p>            </div>
            <h2 id="trivia" class="graphicalheading">      <span>Trivia</span></h2>            <div class="overview">              <p>The phrase &Ograve;won&Otilde;t get fooled again&Oacute; is never in the song. Instead Roger Daltrey sings &Ograve;We don&Otilde;t get fooled again,&Oacute; conveying a tougher attitude.</p>            </div>
            <h2 id="gameplayhints" class="graphicalheading">  <span>Gameplay Hints</span></h2>  <div class="overview">             <p>The drum entrance at the song&Otilde;s end still throws most people off. We&Otilde;re sure Keith Moon wouldn&Otilde;t have it any other way.</p>            </div>
            <h2 id="wherearetheynow" class="graphicalheading"> <span>Where Are They Now?</span></h2>  <div class="overview"> <p>Drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle are no longer around, but Townshend and Daltrey are still flying the flag. We loved &Ocirc;em even before they played our Rock Band 2 announcement party in 2008.</p>         </div>
