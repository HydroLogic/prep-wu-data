			       Census Sensibility

Roughly by importance*difficulty, here's the "Make Mostly Perfect" task list:
  
  * tag datasets by content 

  * list the datafields within each dataset

  * tag those fields by what they mean in real life.

  * Identify fields that recur, and what it means to "recur"; things like
      - State Name          - State Code 
      - Zip Code            - FIPS code
      - Income (US Dollars) - Imports/Exports (US Dollars)
      - Population          - Race
    Define such fields once, somewhere; enter the name preceded by an "&"
    ampersand for all following.

  * separate data (tables, headers, etc) from metadata (notes, sources, etc),
    stuffing the metadata into the appropriate schema slot
  
  * regularize the file naming

  * Spot check that the exported CSV files correctly match the originals

  * Pull each table (with column headers only) into its own file.  
  
  * unravel headers, so there is exactly one field header per data column and
    all tables are rectangular.

  * convert to YAML and XML

  * denormalize and combine equivalent tables

The "useful and ready for import" list stops after item 1 (tag the datasets); anything after that is gravy.  

I'm still figuring out what's hard, what's easy, and what's important -- so do whatever your patience and instincts suggest.  Also: invent shorthands, add or omit structure, &c -- as long as it validates and I can still script the imports, let me know what should be added or tossed.

The files seem to be of the following form. I've extracted what was easily scripted, stuffed it in the schema, and renamed the family.  Beyond that I haven't touched the files themselves.

===========================================================================
    'Table xxx. This Is My Name"

  <header>
    [explanatory text, with possibly some blank lines mixed in]
    [some blank lines]

  <one or more tables:>   
    header,header,header,header,header,header
    [some blank lines]
    cell,cell,cell
   
  <footer: in some order, some of>
    Source: <several lines of source info followed by a blank (comma only) line>
    INTERNET LINK
    FOOTNOTE
    SYMBOLS 
  
===========================================================================

If you see something scripted easily by me and not by you just ask.

love,
#1 grateful bro.
