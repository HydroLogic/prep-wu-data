          A collection of semantically tagged datasets drawn from wikipedia, the
          free encyclopedia.
          
          The datasets here are drawn from thos published by DBpedia, "a
          community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and
          to make this information available on the Web."

          Most of the files in this collection are HUGE.  Really big.

          They're in the RDF triples format, which needs some attention before
          import into a traditional database.  Strongly recommend against the
          .csv files available at dbpedia -- there are pervasive quoting issues
          that break the file format and in other cases lose information.

          From Wikipedia's "'Wikipedia:Ten things you may not know about

          bq. It is in the nature of an ever-changing work like Wikipedia that,
              while some articles are of the highest quality of scholarship,
              others are admittedly complete rubbish. We are fully aware of
              this. We work hard to keep the ratio of the greatest to the worst
              as high as possible, of course, and to find helpful ways to tell
              you in what state an article currently is. Even at its best,
              Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with all the limitations that
              entails. It is not a primary source. We ask you not to criticize
              Wikipedia indiscriminately for its content model but to use it
              with an informed understanding of what it is and what it
              isn't. Also, because some articles may contain errors, please do
              not use Wikipedia to make critical decisions.

            Wikipedia is a multilingual, Web-based, free content encyclopedia
            project. The name Wikipedia is a portmanteau (combination) of the
            words wiki (a type of collaborative website) and
            encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user
            to related pages with additional information.

            Wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers from all around
            the world. Since its creation in 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly
            into one of the largest reference Web sites. There are more than
            75,000 active contributors working on some 9,000,000 articles in
            more than 250 languages. As of today, there are 2,293,986 articles
            in English; every day hundreds of thousands of visitors from around
            the world make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of
            new articles to enhance the knowledge held by the Wikipedia
            encyclopedia. (See also: Wikipedia:Statistics).

            DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from
            Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia
            allows you to ask sophisticated queries against Wikipedia and to link
            other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data.

            DBpedia is an open community project and highly welcomes new contributors.

            The project was started by the following organizations and individuals:

            Sören Auer, Universität Leipzig
            Chris Bizer, Freie Universität Berlin
            Richard Cyganiak, Freie Universität Berlin
            Orri Erling, OpenLink Software
            Kingsley Idehen, OpenLink Software
            Georgi Kobilarov, Freie Universität Berlin
            Jens Lehmann, Universität Leipzig
            Jörg Schüppel, Universität Leipzig

            Thanks a lot for their excellent work on the September 2007 release of the DBpedia dataset to:

            1. Georgi Kobilarov (Freie Universität Berlin) who redesigned and improved the extraction framework and implemented many of the interlinking algorithms.
            2. Piet Hensel (Freie Universität Berlin) who improved the infobox extraction code, wrote the unit test suite.
            3. Richard Cyganiak (Freie Universität Berlin) for his advice on redesigning the architecture of the extraction framework and for helping to solve many annoying Unicode and URI problems.
            4. Zdravko Tashev (OpenLink Software) for his patience to try several times to import buggy versions of the dataset into Virtuoso.
            5. OpenLink Software altogether for providing the Virtuoso database server that hosts the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint and RDF Data Set.
            6. Sören Auer, Jens Lehmann and Jörg Schüppel (Universität Leipzig) for the original version of the infobox extraction code.
            7. Tom Heath and Peter Coetzee (Open University) for the RDFS version of the YAGO class hirarchy.
            8. Fabian M. Suchanek, Gjergji Kasneci (Max-Plank-Institut Saarbrücken) for allowing us to integrate the YAGO classification.
            9. Christian Becker (Freie Universität Berlin) for writing the geo-coordinates and the homepage extractor.
            10. Hans Butschalowsky (Freie Universität Berlin) for the Wikipedia infobox template to Word Net mapping.
            11. Chris Bizer (Freie Universität Berlin) for coordinating the Berlin part of the work and annoying everybody with suggestions and bug reports.
            12. Ivan Herman, Tim Berners-Lee, Rich Knopman and many others for their bug reports.
            13. Vijay Alilaghatta for contributing the Wikipedia-Cyc links.
