Parse:
 map -	in	username	filename
     	out	usr-id		<usr fields>
		twt-id		<twt fields>
		rel-a-b		<rel fields>
 reduce	uniq's the fields, dumps to files by key

2-Neighborhood BFS
 map	in	<rel-a-b>	<ida	idb>
 	out	<rel-b>		<ida	idb	x>
		<rel-a>		<x	ida	idb>
 reduce		<rel-1>		<id1	id2	id3>
 uniqify

 then make 	<rel-a>		<all 1st degree>	<all 2nd degree>
 using list concat as reduce

* recency
* average tweets/day, average follows/day
* urls per tweet, @replies per tweet
* # bidirectional friends
* local clique density (compare the set of people I follow (1st degree) and the set of people they follow (2nd degree).  If I'm completely cliquish, those numbers will be the same, if I'm just clicking on dudes at random the first set has no overlap). This is infeasible to compute but I'm trying to approximate


* 2-hood

* all-pairs shortest distance
  3e6 users => 9e12 naive distances.
  so, this would have to be smart.  There's a "highway" structure.
  - first, though: what is a "connection"? You want something reinforced: symmetric, symmetric @replies (but just those two would trigger on an @zappos), high 2-hood impact <-- best.
  - do it on symm links so it can be all DM's.

* Geolocate all users.  I've pulled off the low-hanging fruit: the top identifiable terms and the iPhone/etc. lat+lng coordinates.  You also have time zone.  Location can change over time
  - how, over a few samples, do you get the 'typical' location of a user? probably the mode (most-commonly-occurring).  Certainly the average doesn't make sense.

* Isolate topic clusters by doing LSA on the twitter stream -- 
   around statistically improbable phrases in each user's tweetstream.  Users who discuss 'purl', 'pearl', 'perl' and 'burl' each have different hobbies.


* There are at least five different networks of users in this dataset:
  - the explicit follower-friend directed network graph
  - the @atsign directed graph
  - geographic clusters
  - hashtag clusters
  - topic clusters
  - [also, tweet_url's -- but this is probably of such low quality as to be useless. Prove me wrong.]

  Visualizing any one of these networks is challenging.  Find meaningful ways to visualize all five and how they interact and correspond.

* How does the network change when you weight the edges?
  - symmetric links
  - high 2-hood links
  - topical correspondence
  - @reply count

* Classifying users:
  
	1-i-hd	Symm	2-hood		@replies	topical diversity	link rate

  Gregarious Celebrity		Zefrank
	Massive, Symmetric, 2-sparse, responsive, eclectic
  Elite Celebrity		Kottke
	
  Elite  Celebrity Entity	Mars Phoenix
  Gregarious Celebrity Entity	BarackObama
 	Massive, Symmetric, 2-sparse, broadcasting, narrow, low std.dev of tweet rate
  Spam Bot
	high tweet_url rate
	followers lag friends -- that is, user B only follows X in response to X first following B.
	narrow topic spectrum
	(follow bot: 
  Antenna Entity		KXAN news, 
 	like a spam bot but broad
	either a narrow topic spectrum OR a narrow geographic spectrum of followers
  Announcer Entity		RUWTBot
	Many followers, friends either none or symmetric. 2-sparse. high tweet_url rate. diverse prestige spectrum of followers.
	... [prediction: announcers, whose purpose is to broadcast, don't follow back or do so reflexively.]

  Regular Joe -- small group of friends, follows some celebrities/entities, 
	moderate, symmetric, 2-dense, moderately responsive, eclectic, bursty
	links at same prestige largely reciprocated.
	links to higher prestige are not.

  Cul de Sac -- uses twitter for their small group of friends and that's it.
	almost completely 2-dense. @atsign and following networks the same. moderate link rate


  Recluse -- 			Lessig
	high follower rate
	low or nil tweet rate

  Quipster --
	low stdev of tweet rate (low burstiness)
 	few @atsigns 
  Actors' Circle		HanneloreEC

  TwitService			hashtags, kvetch

* Is this user's pic a face, a logo, or something else?
