h3. Variable Naming


* use 'num_{grouping_dims}_{variable}' for counts
* use 'tot_{grouping_dims}_{variable}' for sums:

  transactions = LOAD 'transactions' AS (donor_id:long, org_id:long, donation_id:long, amt:double);
  donor_stats  = GROUP transactions BY donor_id, org_id;
  donor_orgs   = FOREACH transactions GENERATE COUNT(transactions) AS num_donor_org_transactions, SUM(amt) AS tot_donor_org_amt;

* when several steps are required to produce the same variable, give each
  the final variable name plus a short suffix:  

    avg_male_heights_ft  = FILTER heights BY gender == 'M' ;
    avg_male_heights_g   = GROUP avg_male_heights_ft BY school_id ;
    avg_male_heights     = FOREACH avg_male_heights_g GENERATE this, that, ...;

  (this logically groups the steps in the same way a subroutine would in
  procedural languages. It says 'these intermediate relations are only
  interesting in service of the base-named relation).

* Use descriptive names. "user_replies" not "grouped"

* 

    total_user_stats       = FOREACH all_group {
      -- yes, I KNOW these can be obtained from the counters, try automating that simply and then we'll talk
      n_users      = (double)COUNT(unique_users);
      sqrt_n_users = org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.math.SQRT(n_users);
      tot_usages   = (double)SUM(unique_users.tot_user_usages);
      GENERATE
        n_users                 AS n_users,
        (sqrt_n_users - 1.0)    AS sqrt_n_users_m1,
        tot_usages              AS tot_usages
        ;
      };


h3. Storing output

    rmf                          $WORDBAG_ROOT/global_tok_stats;
    STORE global_tok_stats INTO '$WORDBAG_ROOT/global_tok_stats';
    global_tok_stats     = LOAD '$WORDBAG_ROOT/global_tok_stats' AS (tok:chararray, ...);

* the default file name and the variable name should match.

* it's optional but appreciated to include the LOAD line following the
  STORE. This makes it easy to concatenate scripts, and to cut and paste for a
  dependent script.
