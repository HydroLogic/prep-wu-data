h3. Cheap consistent sample

If you're 

  users_some   = FILTER users BY (uid % 1000L == 720);

If you later subsample, do (uid / 1000L) % whatever

h3. Robust sampling


h2. Pig anti-tricks

(things it doesn't do, but should)

h3. Map-side SPLIT

Does a case statement; each record is assigned to the first-matching (thus, exactly one) of the alternatives.
If ELSE is omitted, some records may fall through.

h3. Double Group


  transactions = LOAD 'transactions' AS (donor_id:long, org_id:long, donation_id:long, amt:double);
  donor_stats  = GROUP transactions BY donor_id, org_id;
  donor_orgs   = FOREACH transactions {
    donors = SUBGROUP transactions BY donor_id;
    GENERATE group AS COUNT(transactions) AS num_donor_org_transactions, SUM(amt) AS tot_donor_org_amt;
