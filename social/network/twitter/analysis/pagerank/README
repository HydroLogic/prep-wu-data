Running pagerank:

As far as I understand it...

- First run gen_initial_pagerank_graph.rb on a set of twitter relationship objects. after both
  mapping and reducing this should result in a set of data with the following format:

  src1  1.0  link1,link2,...
  src2  1.0  linka,linkb,...
  .
  .
  .

  This is the initial graph where everything has the same probability.
  
- Next, call the set of N links for a src A, l_i. The mapper from pagerank_iterate.rb results in
  N+1 lines given (which may or may not be in this order) as:

  A    '2ids'  l_1,l_2,...,l_N
  l_1  '1pr'   1.0
  l_2  '1pr'   1.0
  .    .       .
  .    .       .
  .    .       .
  l_n  '1pr'   1.0

  
- Lastly, the reducer spits out unique src's A,B,C,etc as well as their damped page rank and the id's of
  everything they link to. Given three sources A,B, and C, each with a set of N links, a_i, b_i, c_i, the
  reducer yields:

  A  x  a_1,a_2,...,a_N
  B  x  b_1,b_2,...,b_N
  C  x  c_1,c_2,...,c_N

  Where x is the damped pagerank value.
