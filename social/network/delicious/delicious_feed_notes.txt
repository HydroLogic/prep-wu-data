Delicious data feeds for news readers and third-party applications

h2. What are feeds at Delicious?

For most pages within Delicious, there are associated read-only data feeds for
bookmarks and other information displayed in a browser. These feeds come in
several formats — including RSS and JSON — and offer windows onto what's going
on at Delicious that you can use in news readers, blogs, or your own third-party
applications.

h2. What is RSS?

RSS is a format used by many news sites and blogs to publish content on the
web. Using RSS to publish content enables news readers and personalized start
pages to pull new stuff all into one place. Applications that understand RSS can
do the footwork and provide a one-stop shop to help readers keep on top of
things without needing to surf all over the web in person.

Accordingly, Delicious offers links to companion RSS feeds on most pages to help
you keep track of bookmarks from other people and on interesting topics. Look
for the orange RSS icon at the bottom of each page.

In addition, many web browsers — such as Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer
— automatically detect RSS feeds associated with pages and offer convenient ways
to subscribe.

h2. What is JSON?

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight
data-interchange format easily used in browser-based mashups, blog badges, and
other scenarios including server-side and desktop applications.

You can use feeds at Delicious in JSON format to fetch, remix, and mashup a
variety of data for use in your own custom applications and browser-based hacks.

h2. A note on freshness

Since feeds at Delicious see quite a bit of high-volume use, it's not practical
to offer immediately fresh results at all times. In particular, RSS feeds may
not be updated more than twice an hour, and JSON feeds are likely to show a
degree of staleness at times as well. Polling feeds more often will not yield
better data, and may result in HTTP 503 Unavailable errors indicating either
that your application has been blocked or the servers are otherwise temporarily
throttling your requests.

h2. Feeds available at Delicious

Feeds at Delicious all share the following base URL prefix:

* http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/{format}/

The placeholder {format} specifies the output format for the feed, which
currently includes the values rss and json.

All feed formats accept the following query-string parameters:

* ?count={1..100} = Limit the results to the given number, between 1 and 100 (default 15)

For RSS format feeds, Delicious performs user-agent detection and, for certain news readers, includes enhanced HTML content in items while minimizing the amount of machine-readable metadata. This feature can be intentionally switched on or disabled with the following URL query-string parameters:

* ?plain = Disable enhanced item HTML content.
* ?fancy = Enable enhanced item HTML content.

To help enable JSON-based mashups, there are a few URL query-string parameters to tweak the JSON output:

* ?callback={js call} = Allows the inclusion of a wrapper function call around the JSON data. The value is filtered by a whitelist consisting of these characters: 0-9 a-z A-Z ()[],._-+=/|\~?!#$^*: '"

The following feed URL patterns use these placeholders:

* {format} = replaced with either "rss" or "json"
* {username} = replaced with a user's login name on delicious
* {tag[+tag+...+tag]} = replaced with a tag or an intersection of tags.
* {url md5} = is intended for the MD5 hash of a URL
* {key} = a security key for the feed, which can be found via the page associated with the feed (eg. inbox).
