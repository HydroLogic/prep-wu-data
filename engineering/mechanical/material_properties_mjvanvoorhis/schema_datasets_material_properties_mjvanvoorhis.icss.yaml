        This table contains mechanical property reference data for steel.

        This table includes Yield strength, Tensile strength, Elongation,
        Reduction in area and Brinnel hardness information.  Data for plain
        carbon and alloy steel with various heat treatments is provided.

        (Tabulated in accordance with the Unified Numbering System for Metals
        and Alloys (UNS), Society of Automotive Engineers, Warrendale, Pa.,
        1975. This reference contains the cross reference numbers for AISI,
        ASTM, FED, MIL SPEC, and SAE specifications. The values shown for
        hot-rolled (HR) and cold drawn (CD) steels are estimated minimum values
        which can usually be expected in the size range of 3/4 to 1-1/4 in. A
        minimum value is roughly several standard deviations below the
        arithmetic mean. The values shown for heat-treated steels are so-called
        typical values. A typical value is neither the mean nor the minimum. It
        can be obtained by careful control of the purchase specifications and
        the heat-treatment, together with continuous inspection and testing. The
        properties shown in this table are from a variety of sources and are
        believed to be representative. There are so many variables which affect
        these properties, however, that their approximate nature must be clearly
        recognized. Multiply strength in kpsi by 6.89 to get strength in MPa.)

        washer-faced or with chamfered corners. Diameters of bearing surface 
        shall be 95 percent of maximum width across flats within a tolerance of

        of body within a tolerance of 2 degrees for sizes up to and including 1 in,

        surface of the head to the first complete thread shall not exceed the 
        length of 2-1/2 threads, as measured with a ring thread gauge, for sizes

        Threads shall be coarse, fine, or 8-thread series, class 2A for plain 
        (unplated) cap screws. For plated cap screws, the diamters may be increased

        lengths over 1 in to and including 2 in; and minus 3/32 in for lengths

        in a sleeve gauge; the deviation of shank from a surface plate on which 
        it is rolled shall not exceed 0.0312 in. A suggested gauge is shown in 
        the Appendix. For sizes over 3/4 in total runout shall be subject to 
        negotiation. Unless otherwise specified, physical properties of steel 
        cap screws shall correspond to SAE Grades 2 or 5. Cap screws may also

        therefore the maximum total runout of bearing face would equal the
        tangent of specified angle times the distance across the flats. Thread
        shall be coarse, fine, or 8-thread series, class 2B. Suitable material
        for steel nuts is covered by ASTM A-307; other materials will be as
        agreed upon by manufacturer and user.  Tolerance on width across flats
        may be increased 0.015 in for hot-formed nuts 5/8 in and smaller.

        Torque and Stress for Threads - Suggested Torque Values (+/- 5%) to
        Produce Corresponding Bolt Loads

        This table contains stress area, proof load, clamp load and
        assembly torques (dry and lubricated) for threaded fasteners ranging in 
        thread size from #4 to 4-1/2 inch nominal  Unified thread size.  
        Data is provided for grade 2, grade 5, grade 8 and grade 9 fasteners.

        <img alt="Grade Illustration" src="grade.gif">

        NOTES:
            
        1.  Clamp load = 75% * Proof * stress area.
        
        2.  Torque is R * D * T where R = .200 (dry) or .150 (lubricated), D =
            Nominal diameter (inch) and T = Desired clamp load (lbs).
            Lubricated includes lubricants, lubrizing plating and hardened
            washers.
