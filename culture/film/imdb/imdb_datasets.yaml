3.1 Cast Lists
--------------

  List                 | Maintained by
  ---------------------|-------------------------------------------
  Actors               | Giancarlo Cairella <actors@imdb.com>
  Actresses            | Giancarlo Cairella <actresses@imdb.com>
  Cast Completion      | Col Needham <cn@imdb.com>
  ---------------------|-------------------------------------------


Each filmography entry consists of up to five pieces of information: the 
name, the title, an attributes field (to store, for example, academy award 
nominations), the character name and a number to specify their position in
the credits. 

Please note that guest appearances on TV-shows are not eligible for the cast
databases owing to the volume and accuracy of this type of information. Guest
appearances for well-known people can be stored separately in the biographies
section.

Note that the actors and actress lists only contain filmography information -
biographical data such as date and place of birth, real name etc. is stored
in the biographies list.

The cast completion list simply records which movies have full cast lists
in the database (i.e. everyone listed in the credits of the movie is in the 
actors/actresses lists).


3.2 Crew Lists
--------------

The following lists are of a similar format to the cast lists in that they
contain filmographies for people in the respective fields:

  List                 | Maintained by
  ---------------------|-------------------------------------------
  Cinematographers     | Michel Hafner <cinematographers@imdb.com>
  Composers            | Michel Hafner <composers@imdb.com>
  Costume Designers    | Peter Simeon <costumes@imdb.com>
  Directors            | Michel Hafner <directors@imdb.com>
  Editors              | Peter Simeon <editors@imdb.com>
  Misc. Filmography    | Peter Simeon <misc-crew@imdb.com>
  Producers            | Andre Bernhardt <producers@imdb.com>
  Production Designers | Peter Simeon <prod-designers@imdb.com>
  Writers              | Jon Reeves <writers@imdb.com>
  ---------------------|-------------------------------------------

The miscellaneous filmography list is a "catch all" for people in careers not
covered by the other filmography lists. Anyone who worked on a movie can be 
listed here. The idea is to spin-off new filmography lists from it if the 
volume of data relating to a particular type of contribution justifies a new 
separate list.


3.3 Titles Lists
----------------

The following sections contain information relating to individual titles:
