MSDS data from hazard.com is read into a simple ruby hash with the following keys:

KEYS:
-----
Accidental Release Measures
Physical/Chemical Properties
First Aid Measures
Product Identification
MSDS Transport Information
Exposure Controls/Personal Protection
Handling and Storage
Hazards Identification
Fire Fighting Measures
Regulatory Information
Composition/Information on Ingredients
Other
Other Information
Disposal Considerations
Ecological Information
Stability and Reactivity Data
Toxicological Information

All of these should have further structure (ie. subsections) but parsing these is
too time consuming at the moment. Hence, each key from the above simply points to
an unparsed chunk of text associated with that msds section.
