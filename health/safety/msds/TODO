* Make parse_hzrd_msds.rb read from the work directory and devour msds data

        - work/ripd/...

* For every msds file here:
   
        - read contents into ruby hash
        - every key in the hash is an msds section
        - every value in the hash is the content for the msds section
        - put data from hash into datamapper fields
        - dump to MySQL database
      
* Be happy
