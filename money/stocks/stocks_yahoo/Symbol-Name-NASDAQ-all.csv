Overview

We have developed and manufacture a minimally invasive system based on our
proprietary cryoablation technology for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.
Cardiac arrhythmias are dysfunctions in the electrical activity of the heart
that normally controls and maintains the highly coordinated contractions of the
heart. Arrhythmias cause the heart to pump blood less efficiently, cause
potentially debilitating symptoms and can result in life threatening events such
as stroke. We have focused our initial development efforts on designing a system
for treating atrial fibrillation, or AF, and atrial flutter, or AFL, the two
most common and difficult to treat arrhythmias. AF is the most prevalent
arrhythmia.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2007%2f03%2f30%2f0001193125-07-070601.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"

Company believes that alternatives to costly hospital and nursing home stays
will continue to create demand for home health care. Medicare, Medicaid and
other managed care insurance companies continue to look for a setting whereby
the aged population can receive health care services most cost efficiently. Home
health care has evolved as the acceptable and most preferred alternative in this
continuum. Patient comfort and substantial cost savings can generally be
realized through treatment at home as an alternative to traditional
institutional settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2006%2f10%2f31%2f0000910680-06-001035.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"

interests of the company and its stockholders to not conduct further clinical
trials for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor 2, or VEGF-2, for the treatment of

authorized management to immediately reduce its cash spending and to continue

cells in the inner lining of the artery, leading to the formation of plaque or
lesions. Accumulation of plaque in the arteries narrows the diameter of the
inner channel of the artery, or the lumen, which reduces blood flow. During an
IVUS procedure, an imaging catheter is placed inside an artery to produce a

The State of the Industry

As demands for connectivity, security, and mobility increase, devices across
many industries are becoming more complex. In order to meet these needs, device
manufacturers are designing more feature-rich products driven by smaller, more
powerful microprocessors that require increasingly sophisticated software
operating systems to run them.

shrinking margins down their supply chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2007%2f05%2f01%2f0001193125-07-097860.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"

emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and lay rescuers advance the practice
of resuscitation.

 

To understand resuscitation, it is important to first provide background
information about:

 

  •   The anatomy of the heart;


 

    •   Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and how rapid, life-saving interventions can   
        help SCA patients;                                                         


 

  •   The different arrhythmias that can lead to SCA;


 

  •   The issue of traumatic injury and its effects that can also lead to SCA;


 

    •   Recent developments and new research in the areas of emergency             
        cardiovascular care and the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation   
        (CPR); and
