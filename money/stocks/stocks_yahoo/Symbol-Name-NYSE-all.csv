acquisitions and focused exploration on and around its operating properties.
Barrick believes there is a higher probability of finding new mineral reserves
around existing mines. Once found, these new reserves can be developed more
quickly and profitably due to existing infrastructure. The Company’s strategy is
to maintain a geographic mix of projects at different stages in the exploration
and development sequence. The low gold price environment that existed in recent
years required that major mining companies undertake more early stage
exploration than in the past because junior exploration companies had been less
active, and there were fewer new discoveries to buy or joint ventures to fund.
Accordingly, Barrick is engaged in early stage exploration in four major areas
where it possesses significant infrastructure: Peru, Tanzania, Australia and
Chile/Argentina.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More...""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2006%2f03%2f31%2f0000909567-06-000513.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" &nbsp;&nbsp;"

RADIO

Description of the Industry
The Canadian radio industry has historically been fragmented, with most stations
being owned locally and oriented towards local advertisers and markets. In April
1998, the CRTC adopted a new radio multiple ownership policy. In any market
where there are at least eight commercial radio stations in English or French, a
single owner can own as many as two AM and two FM stations in that language.
Since then, there has been a significant amount of consolidation of ownership
within the radio industry.

According to the CRTC, as of August 31, 2005, there were 554 commercial radio
stations in Canada of which approximately 68% were FM stations and 32% were AM
stations.

arc furnaces to melt scrap metal by charging it with electricity. During melting
of scrap metal, alloys and other ingredients (such as fluxes) are added in
measured quantities to achieve desired metallurgical properties. The resulting
molten steel is cast into long strands called billets in a continuous casting
process. The billets are typically cooled and stored, and then transferred to a
rolling mill where they are reheated, passed through roughing mills for size
reduction, and then rolled into products such as rebar, merchant bars,
structural shapes, rods or special sections. These products emerge from the
rolling mill and are uniformly cooled on a cooling bed. Most merchant and
structural products then pass through automated straightening and stacking
equipment. Finished products are neatly bundled prior to shipment to customers,

In 1922, Paul and Florence Kunin opened Kunin Beauty Salon, which quickly
expanded into a chain of value priced salons located in department stores. In
1958, the chain was purchased by their son and renamed Regis Corporation. In
recent years, the Company purchased Hair Club for Men and Women. During fiscal
year 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to contribute its 51 accredited
cosmetology schools to Empire Education Group, Inc. The transaction closed on
August 1, 2007 (fiscal year 2008). Additionally, the Company continues to
acquire hair and retail product salons. Regis Corporation is listed on the NYSE
