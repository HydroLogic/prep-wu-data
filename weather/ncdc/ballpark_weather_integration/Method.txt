-- We have a list of all the parks, and a list of stations.  Let's get a shorter list:

-- For each ballpark with lat/lng info and a game this century, 
-- find all weather stations inside a 1 degree box
-- CREATE TABLE vizsagedb_foo.ParkStations 
SELECT P.parkID, P.lat AS latP, P.lng AS lngP, P.beg as begP, P.end AS endP, P.games, P.name as parkName,
		SQRT((P.lat-SI.lat)*(P.lat-SI.lat) + (P.lng-SI.lng)*(P.lng-SI.lng)) AS fakedist, 
		SI.*
  FROM		-- All parks with lat lng info and games this century
			( SELECT parkID, lat, lng, beg, end, games, name FROM vizsagedb_foo.Parks_parks 
				WHERE (lat IS NOT NULL) AND (YEAR(end)>1900) ) P
  LEFT JOIN vizsagedb_weather.StationInfoISH SI
			-- Choose stations that are within a +/- 1 degree square: 1 degree is an arbitrary figure
	ON		(ABS(P.lat-SI.lat) < 1) AND (ABS(P.lng-SI.lng) < 1) 
  ORDER BY	parkID ASC, fakedist ASC

-- I removed the CREATE TABLE line when the query looked right.

-- Look at a particular the station history
SELECT * FROM StationHistISH SH
LEFT JOIN vizsagedb_weather.StationInfoISH SI ON 	(SI.ID_USAF = SH.ID_USAF) AND (SI.ID_NCDC = SH.ID_NCDC)
WHERE CONCAT(SH.ID_USAF,'-',SH.ID_NCDC) IN ('999999-23131')  

-- Get the number of records for each station during the park's time period.
SELECT  
	MIN(SH.year) AS begS, MAX(SH.year) AS endS, 
	1+MAX(SH.year)-MIN(SH.year) AS years, COUNT(*) AS nMonths, 
	SUM(n_records) as n_records,
