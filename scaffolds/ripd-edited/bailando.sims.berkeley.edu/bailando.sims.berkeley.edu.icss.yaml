            This website is the UC Berkeley SIMS group's page.  The
            group has a focus on creating new ways to access and
            display information.  One of their projects is a
            visualizer for a collection of emails from Enron
            employees.  It is this project's data that should be in
            Infochimps.

            This dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project
            (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It
            contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior
            management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus
            contains a total of about 0.5M messages. This data was
            originally made public, and posted to the web, by the
            Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its
            investigation.
