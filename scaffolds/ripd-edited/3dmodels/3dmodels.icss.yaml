            3dmodels.com is a website which hosts images, wireframes,
            animations, textures, &c, in a variety of formats for use
            in modeling and the design of software.

            No explicit rights statement is included at the website.
            Claims of its being a "marketplace" seem to contradict
            other phrases such as "grow this collection for the
            benefit of our community."

        Close your eyes....
        (Yes, we know you can keep on reading with your eyes closed!)

        Imagine your next 3D Project...  Imagine developing all of the
        content for your video, game, movie, etc...  Countless hours
        developing wireframes, animation, textures, and more.  Yes, we
        feel your pain...

        Now, imagine a marketplace for 3D models and content.  Imagine
        being able to find complete models, wireframes, animations,
        textures and more...  Quickly and easily find assets
        appropriate for your project.  Imagine being able to
        contribute to this marketplace to improve and grow this
        collection for the benefit of our community.

        We are developing such a site.  A member-driven marketplace
        for 3D content and services.  We look forward to empowering
        the 3D in all of us.

        Check back with us soon as we make this vision a 3D reality.
