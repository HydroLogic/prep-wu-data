      accurate:
        desc: The semantic quality is very poor. There is no uniform structure for many of these documents.
        rating: 1
      authoritative:
        desc: 'Data is provided by the manufacturer, but must be gathered willy-nilly (there is no central repository) and therefore no way to trace their provenance'
        rating: 2
      comprehensive:
        desc: 'Although extensive, this by no means represents more than a fraction of the published MSDS.  (Most live behind corporate firewalls and bureaucratic barriers.  If you have access to a collection, or would like to help organize these, you can help set this data free and perhaps save lives in the process.)'
        rating: 2
      interesting:
        desc: 'Very difficult to find for free, but of narrow interest'
