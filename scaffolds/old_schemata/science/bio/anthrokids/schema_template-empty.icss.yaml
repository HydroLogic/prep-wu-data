            The creation of a publically accessable data base is the result of a joint effort between
            the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 
            Technology (NIST) and the CPSC. Partial sponsorship is coming from the Systems Integration
            for Manufacturing Applications (SIMA) project at NIST. Prior to this effort the data did
            not exist other than on paper.
