      Special thanks to Jean Meeus for providing the Besselian elements used in the solar eclipse predictions.
      
      All eclipse calculations are by Fred Espenak, and he assumes full responsibility for their accuracy. Some of the information presented on this web site is based on data originally published in Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000.

  Tables of solar eclipse local circumstances include the following data. The calendar date and Dynamical Time of the instant of greatest eclipse[1] are found in the first two columns. Delta T (ΔT) gives the arithmetic difference between Dynamical Time and Universal Time. The lunation number (since 2000 Jan 06) and the Saros series are listed along with the eclipse type (P=Partial, A=Annular, T=Total or H=Hybrid[2]) Gamma is the distance of the shadow axis from Earth's center at greatest eclipse while the eclipse magnitude is defined as the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured at that instant. The geographic latitude and longitude of the umbra are given for greatest eclipse, along with the Sun's altitude and azimuth, the width of the path (kilometers) and the central line duration of totality or annularity. For both partial and non-central umbral/antumbral eclipses, the latitude and longitude correspond to the point closest to the shadow cone axis at greatest eclipse. The Sun's altitude is always 0° at this location.
  The data presented in the catalog are based on the Five Millennium Canon of Solar Eclipses: -1999 to +3000.
  
  # Greatest eclipse is defined as the instant when the axis of the Moon's shadow passes closest to Earth's center. For total eclipses, the instant of greatest eclipse is virtually identical to the instants of greatest magnitude and greatest duration. However, for annular eclipses, the instant of greatest duration may occur at either the time of greatest eclipse or near the sunrise and sunset points of the eclipse path.
  # Hybrid eclipses are also known as annular/total eclipses. They occur when the vertex of the Moon's umbral shadow pierces Earth's surface along the central path of an annular eclipse. The eclipse's character then changes to total along the section of the path where the umbral vertex extends beneath Earth's surface. The central paths of hybrid eclipses usually (but not always) begin and end as annular eclipses, but become total along some middle portion of the path.
