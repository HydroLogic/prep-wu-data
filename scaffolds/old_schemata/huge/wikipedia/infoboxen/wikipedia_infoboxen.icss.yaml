    Any creative content contained in here is copyright of its author.
    
    The dataset itself represents a comprehensive indexing of factual information, and is given here in a unique and novel presentation.
    Wikipedia, the redistributor of the source material, asserts this copyright on its creative content:
        
    "Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".  Content on Wikipedia is covered by disclaimers.
    If you want to use Wikipedia materials in your own books/articles/web sites or other publications, you can do so, but you have to follow the GFDL. If you are simply duplicating the Wikipedia article, you must follow section two of the GFDL on verbatim copying, as discussed at Wikipedia:Verbatim copying.
    
    If you create a derivative version by changing or adding content, this entails the following:
    * your materials in turn have to be licensed under GFDL,
    
    * you must acknowledge the authorship of the article (section 4B), and
    * you must provide access to the "transparent copy" of the material
      (section 4J). (The "transparent copy" of a Wikipedia article is any of
      a number of formats available from us, including the wiki text, the
      html web pages, xml feed, etc.)
    
    You may be able to partially fulfill the latter two obligations by providing a conspicuous direct link back to the Wikipedia article hosted on this website. You also need to provide access to a transparent copy of the new text. However, please note that the Wikimedia Foundation makes no guarantee to retain authorship information and a transparent copy of articles. Therefore, you are encouraged to provide this authorship information and a transparent copy with your derived works."
