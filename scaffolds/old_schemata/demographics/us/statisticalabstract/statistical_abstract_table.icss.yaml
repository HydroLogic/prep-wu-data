        The Statistical Abstract of the United States is the standard summary of statistics on the social, political, and economic organization of the United States. It is also designed to serve as a guide to other statistical publications and sources. The latter function is served by the introductory text to each section, the source note appearing below each table, and Appendix I, which comprises the Guide to Sources of Statistics, the Guide to State Statistical Abstracts, and the Guide to Foreign Statistical Abstracts.
        This volume includes a selection of data from many statistical sources, both government and private. Publications cited as sources usually contain additional statistical detail and more comprehensive discussions of definitions and concepts. Data not available in publications issued by the contributing agency but obtained from the Internet or unpublished records are identified in the source notes. More information on the subjects covered in the tables so noted may generally be obtained from the source.

        Although emphasis in the Statistical Abstract is primarily given to national data, many tables present data for regions and individual states and a smaller number for metropolitan areas and cities. Appendix II, Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: Concepts, Components, and Population, presents explanatory text, a complete current listing and population data for metropolitan and micropolitan areas defined as of December 2005. Statistics for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and for island areas of the United States are included in many state tables and are supplemented by information in Section 29. Additional information for states, cities, counties, metropolitan areas, and other small units, as well as more historical data are available in various supplements to the Abstract.
      file_structure: |-
        The Statistical Abstract files are distributed by the census department as excel files.  These files have data mixed with notes and references, multiple tables per sheet, and worst of all the table headers aren't easily matched to their rows and columns.
        The excel files in this collection are unmolested copies of the census originals, with the following exceptions:

        # A few files had extraneous characters in the title.  These were
          corrected to be consistent.  A few files have a sheet of crufty
          gibberish in the first slot.  The sheet order was shuffled but no
          data were changed.

          The tables that were changed:

          0166 0257 0362 0429 0445 0446 0459 0461 0462 0464 0465 0466 0467
          0469 0479 0480 0481 0482 0483 0484 0485 0486 0487 0559 0628 0629
          1144 1227 1231

        # The first four files have been restructured to allow full
          comprehension of the table.  If you'd like to help clean up the data
          follow along with what's there.

        The CSV files, and the payload portions of the yaml files, have not been processed beyond extracting an array (excel sheets) of 2-D arrays (each sheet's cells).

        Some metadata (title, footnotes, symbols, and sources) has been copied (without molesting the imported stream) into the appropriate slot in this schema. This metadata identification was purposefully done to be strict and simple, and the original files are somewhat irregular, so it's possible that some metadata fields were missed


        These files have been tagged by hand and received cursory inspection, but you're advised to check against the originals before you go lauching any Mars rovers.
