# File lists
# In section 1.3 on page 4 of the introduction chapter we wrote:
# 
# "The BNC has now been produced in two versions. The original release (Version
# 1.0) was distributed from 1995. The new BNC (Version 2.0), at the time of
# going of press, is expected to be released in the winter of 2000/1. The new
# release, unlike the old one, is to be available (under licence) worldwide. It
# has certain advantages over the old version, notably (a) improved accuracy of
# grammatical tagging (undertaken at Lancaster in 1995-96), and (b) correction
# of details of text classification, which has resulted in the transfer of about
# a million words from the 'imaginative' category of written texts to the
# 'informative' category. However, it has also been necessary to reduce the size
# of the BNC in the worldwide release by 69 texts, owing to the difficulty or
# impossibility of obtaining world rights for the distribution of those
# texts. For the purposes of this book, we are using the complete BNC of Version
# 1.0, and at the same time are making use of the improvements of Version 2.0 -
# including improved grammatical tagging and text category corrections. This
# ensures that we base our frequency lists on the best and fullest information
# available."
# 
# In order to make clear the contents of each section of the BNC, we list here
# the files in each major subcorpus as used in the book. This reflects the
# classification of texts at time of going to press. For any more recent changes
# in classification, you may wish to browse the BNC Indexer produced by David
# Lee. In the table below, click on the number of files in each case to see the
# corresponding list of files.
