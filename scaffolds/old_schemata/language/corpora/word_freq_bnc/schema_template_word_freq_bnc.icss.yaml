            Books of English word frequencies have in the past suffered from
            severe limitations of sample size and breadth. They have also tended
            to be restricted to word forms alone. Most importantly, almost all
            have dealt only with written language. This book overcomes these
            limitations. It is derived from the British National Corpus - a
            100,000,000 word electronic databank sampled from the whole range of
            present-day English, spoken and written - and makes use of the
            grammatical information that has been added to each word in the
            corpus.

            Key features Includes frequencies for present-day speech (including everyday conversation) as well as for writing

            * Rank-ordered and alphabetical frequency lists for the whole corpus and for various subdivisions: e.g. informative vs. imaginative writing, conversational vs. other varieties of speech
            * Entries take account of grammatical parts of speech (e.g. round as a preposition is listed separately from round as an adjective)
            * Includes discussions of a number of thematic frequency lists such as colour terms, female vs. male terms, etc

            Each dataset in this collection contains a list of words with
            grammatical information (so as to separate different uses of the
            same word) and frequencies in written and spoken English culled
            from the British National Corpus (BNC), a 100,000,000 word electronic
            databank.

            The BNC project was
            carried out and is managed by an industrial/academic consortium
            lead by Oxford University Press, of which the other members are
            major dictionary publishers Addison-Wesley Longman and Larousse
            Kingfisher Chambers; academic research centres at Oxford
            University Computing Services, Lancaster University's Centre for
            Computer Corpus Research on Language, and the British Library's
            Research and Innovation Centre.
            
            The data collected by the BNC was analyzed and published as

            Each dataset in this collection is drawn from one chapter of
            this book.  Different datasets (chapters) compare different components of
            the BNC, ie. - written vs. spoken English or conversational vs.
            task-oriented language.

  # 
  #       Dispersion value (Juilland's D) from a minimum of 0.00 to a maximum of 1.00.
  # 
  #       Dispersion measures how _typical_, as opposed to _common_ a word is.
  #       For example, the words "enthalpy" (a term from chemistry) and "wrestle"
  #       both occur in the BNC at roughly 3 parts per million.  However, it seems
  #       likely that only a few documents would mention 'enthalpy' (and that
  #       those few were so excited about it they used it over and over again).
  #       The dispersion of 'enthalpy' comes in at 0.15 -- values near zero
  #       indicate concentration in a very few texts.  The dispersion for
  #       'wrestle', on the other hand, comes in at a near-ubiquitous 0.92 --
  #       values near one show uniform usage frequency throughout the corpus.
  #       
  #       To find Juilland's D,
  #       
  #         For each equal chunk [c1, c2, ... cN] within the corpus, take the
  #         corpus component frequencies freqs = [f1, f2, ... fn].  Next get the
  #         coefficient of variation V as
  #         
  #           V = std_dev(freqs) / mean(freqs)
  #         
  #         The dispersion coerces the values within the range 0 (all occurrences
  #         came from a single chunk) to 1 (every chunk had exactly the same
  #         number of occurrences):
  # 
  #            D = 1 - ( V / sqrt(n-1) )
  #            
  #         (a little bit of thought and the back of a napkin will show this
  #         indeed ranges from 0 to 1)
