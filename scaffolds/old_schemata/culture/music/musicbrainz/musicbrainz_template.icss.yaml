              The files in this directory are snapshots of the MusicBrainz database,
              in a format suitable for import into a PostgreSQL database. To import
              them, you need a compatible version of the MusicBrainz server software.

              Use the following command for checking out the mb_server revision
              which created the snapshots:

              <code>
              svn co http://svn.musicbrainz.org/mb_server/branches/RELEASE_20071014-BRANCH mb_server
              </code>

              (Substitute the date of the release you download in that command.)

              After that, follow the instructions given in mb_server/INSTALL.

              artist name, the release title, and the list of tracks that appear
              on a release. Since 2005, users have the option to further relate

            This document describes the database structure of the MusicBrainz
            database, as of the Subversion copy at 20th August 2003. It is not
            meant to be a complete definition or any kind of definitive
            reference - it is just a series of pictures with some narrative,
            intended to be helpful to people trying to understand the overall
            form of the database. Also the diagrams were not produced
            automatically or anything - they were done by hand, so many contain
            errors. Please be forgiving if this is the case.
            
            h2. This document is partially outdated

            !!! This document does not describe the current state of the
            MusicBrainz database, but is a snapshot of how it looked like in mid
            2003. In the meantime AdvancedRelationships were introduced and many
            other small but substantial changes. Please check the images against
            the up-to-date [WWW] CreateTables.sql script. The other scripts in
            the [WWW] sql directory give more details about index, foreign key,
            and serial number management workings of the MusicBrainz
            Server. Please be advised that you'll need to understand the
            fundamentals of SQL before these scripts will make sense to you.
            Future plans
            
            Note also the near-future "ObjectModel":http://musicbrainz.org/doc/ObjectModel
            schema migrations.

            We also used to attempt to document our future plans for the
            database. But, as it is typical in software engineering, our
            implementations never matched our speculations about how we thought
            we'd do things in the future. In order to get a gimpse of what we
            are working on the for the future, take a look a the MusicBrainz
            Development page which describes the CurrentWork being done on
            MusicBrainz. There is a page on how a NextGenerationSchema could
            look like, and an ObjectModel that goes with it. It is not clear at
            this time (05/2006) if, and when these changes get implemented.
            
            The Whole Database in Miniature

            Firstly let's just take a quick look at the whole database, in all its glory, all twenty-five tables of it:

            relationships provide information about web resources
            (e.g. Wikipedia pages, download locations, etc) for entities and
            they can indicate instrument/vocal performances on a piece of
            music. These relationships allow
            "MusicBrainz":http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz to capture most
            of the data contained in the liner and liner notes for an Audio
            CD. For more details on these relationships, please read our
            AdvancedRelationships page.

            The MusicBrainz database is built on the [WWW] Postgres relational
            database engine. Therefore the data files are provided in the
            Postgres "dump" format, only really suitable for restoring to a
            Postgres database. See the
            "DatabaseSchema":http://musicbrainz.org/doc/DatabaseSchema

            tables are used for.

            There are a few contributed guidelines how to setup the database on

            documents. The easiest way to get a running database is to install a
