      what_is_the_internet_movie_database: >-
        The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an international organization whose 
        objective is to provide useful and up to date movie information *freely* 
        available on-line, across as many systems and platforms as possible. It 
        currently covers over 150,000 movies with over 2,100,000 filmography entries
        and is expanding continuously. The service is financed by advertising and 
        sponsorship. The Internet Movie Database is a Limited Company registered
        in the UK.

        The database includes filmographies for actors, directors, writers, composers,
        cinematographers, editors, production designers, costume designers, producers
        and a miscellaneous catch all section; plot summaries; character names; movie
        ratings; year of release; running times; movie trivia; quotes; goofs;
        soundtracks; personal trivia; alternative names; certificates; color
        information; country of production; genres; production companies; sound mix;
        reference literature; filming locations; sequel/remake information; release
        dates; advertising tag lines; detailed technical data; alternative versions;
        laserdisc availability; language; special effects; distributors; box office
        grosses; movie posters; video sales links and Academy Award information. 

        The database aims to capture any and all information associated with movies 
        from across the world, starting with the earliest cinema, going through to the
        very latest releases and even movies still in production. Many thousands of 
        movies are covered completely from the major actors to the minor bit players
        and crew members. The database is updated weekly and is available over the 
        World Wide Web, an e-mail interface or for local installation on Unix, Amiga 
        OS/2, Windows 95/NT (text only), Amiga and MS-DOS machines.

        In its seven year hidesc the IMDb has grown from a small informal project to 
        a major Internet resource. The WWW interface to the database is one of the most 
        popular and well-known sites of any class on the web. It is frequently cited 
        as a model for how to create and organise a major web site and has received 
        numerous awards and honours over the years.

      hidesc:
        So where did it all start? Well, it all began back in 1989 when someone
        started a discussion in the USENET newsgroup rec.arts.movies about who were the
        most attractive looking actresses around. In response to this thread, a college
        student in the US began to collect a list of all the actresses, along with the
        movies they had appeared in. The list was pretty disorganised to say the least
        and the original maintainer disappeared from the net after a few months. At 
        this point Andy Krieg picked up the list, sorted it properly and began to post
        it monthly to rec.arts.movies under the title "THE LIST".

        In May of 1989 Chuck Musciano started the Movie Ratings Report, an on-going
        poll of movies posted weekly to the group. The two projects remained entirely
        separate for a couple of years, but it is appropriate to mention the start
        of the report here.

        I started the actors list in August 1990 and it proved a big
        success, growing very rapidly over a short space of time. It was limited
        to living actors (like the actress list) to keep the size down. Being a fan
        of older movies I was disappointed that I couldn't include some of my
        favourite actors since they were dead. Later that month I asked for
        volunteers to run a dead actors/actresses list and when nobody came
        forward I started the dead list. 

        In September 1990 Dave Knight volunteered to manage a directors list to
        complement the cast lists. Seeing all the lists in rec.arts.movies, Grant 
        Mason, a post-graduate student at Edinburgh, posted a request asking for some
        software to search the lists as a whole. Since I already had some very
        basic list processing shell scripts, I volunteered to publish them and the 
        Internet Movie Database was born.

        Within a month, Jeff Sullivan volunteered to manage a writers list and by
        the end of 1990 Michel Hafner was managing the composers and cinematographers
        lists. Michel had some ideas on creating master reference lists of names and
        titles to keep everything consistent across the lists. He also suggested a
        list structure based on relations that was adopted.

        Throughout '91 and '92 the lists and software grew rapidly. Support was added
        for the movie ratings report and Michel's titles list which now meant you
        could access ratings and the year-of-release information in the database. 
        Michel also launched a master reference list of alternative titles which 
        enabled lots of redundancy in the database to be eliminated. Some of the 
        original list managers had to give up their lists so things swapped around a
        little during this time. We got access to an FTP site at the University of 
        Colorado which helped significantly since the data was then available all
        the time.

        Towards the end of '92 Steve Hammond volunteered to manage a character names
        database and Murray Chapman started the trivia list, agreeing to make it
        compatible with the software. Early in '93 Colin Tinto volunteered to start
        a plot summaries list and February '93 saw the launch of the first version of 
        the software that was mostly in C. Jon Reeves also joined the team, taking 
        over the writers list.

        Around this time we discussed the idea of making the database available on an
        e-mail server somewhere. Alan Jay volunteered to create and run it at the PC
        users group in London. The movie mail-server went public in the summer of '93
        and still continues to serve hundreds of requests per day despite the increased
        availability of the web to most Internet users.

        In August '93 the cast lists were reorganised slightly so that all the data 
        was available to the movie database package (up until then only entries for 
        people with a certain number of requests were available publicly).

        In September '93 Mark Harding volunteered to manage a biographies list and
        the crazy credits section which used to be part of the trivia list. Rob 
        Hartill set up a WWW interface to the database at Cardiff University. Also at
        this time, Andre Bernhardt expressed an interest in porting the movie database
        software to the Amiga and a release followed shortly afterwards.

        At the end of '93 I took over the actresses list from Andy Krieg. The six cast
        lists were merged to two, with the posted versions just being subsets of the 
        full versions on the anonymous FTP sites. New filmography lists for editors, 
        production designers and costume designers were also released. Henry Lebovic 
        approached us about an MS-DOS interface to the database that he had been 
        working on.

        In March '94 Andre volunteered to manage a producers filmography list, Lars
        Joergen Aas a quotes list, Ron Higgins a soundtracks list and support for
        the movie goofs list was added. Rob began to look at setting up mirror sites 
        for his heavily used WWW interface database and mirrors appeared in Mississippi
        (run by Frank Peters), Australia (run by Mike Lawley), Iceland (run by Mark 
        Townley), Germany (run by Wolfgang Klimt) and Japan (run by Jun-ichiro 
        "itojun" Itoh). Also, Henry released CineBASE, the MS-DOS interface to the 
        database, making the whole system accessible to even more people.

        In April '94 the movie mail-server additions interface was launched, meaning
        that updates for the whole database could now be sent to the same address,
        significantly simplifying things for the database managers and users.

        In May '94 the running times list was added to the database and the cast 
        lists were reorganised to include the character names.

        During the latter part of '94 the new easier template based additions system,
        designed and managed by Mark Harding, was launched. This opened the database
        to many new contributors who'd previously been put-off by the long addition
        guidelines.

        In October '94 eight new lists were added to the database, significantly 
        increasing the range of information available. The new lists were: alternative
        names, certificates, color information, countries, genres, miscellaneous 
        filmographies, production companies and sound mix. The cast lists were enhanced
        to include credit ordering information, enabling the stars of each movie 
        to be identified easily.

        In December '94 seven further lists were added, making virtually every class
        of movie information available within the database. The new lists were: the
        cast completion tracking, literature, locations, movie links, release dates,
        tag lines and technical information.

        During the early part of 1995 further WWW mirrors were added, newer sites
        being Korea, South Africa and a second site in the USA. A monthly IMDb
        newsletter was started, although the rate of growth on the database means
        it doesn't get published as often as it should. A new section describing
        the reasons behind the MPAA ratings was added to the database.

        In November '95 three new lists were added: the alternate versions list,
        managed by Giancarlo Cairella and the LaserDisc and ISO alternative titles
        lists, managed by Peter Simeon. The latter list being part of our long term
        effort to support international character sets within the database. Coinciding
        with the new lists, the WWW was completely rewritten from scratch by Rob. The
        new interface featured many new options and pages, complete with new icons
        designed by Mike Massee.

        In December '95 in an attempt to improve our WWW service we trimmed the number
        of mirror sites down to the four which were able to keep up with the growth
        in data volume and user traffic which the IMDb now receives.

        In March '96 the IMDb moved onto a professional footing and became a 
        sponsorship and advertising supported service. Almost immediately we were able
        to make numerous improvements to the database, including a complete rewrite of
        the web interface to make it run faster. Also, the business information section
        managed by Giancarlo Cairella was added at the same time. This new section 
        details box office grosses, budgets, studio locations and various other 
        business related information.

        h4. Easier Ways to Submit New Data
          
        If you find the standard addition formats too complex there is an alternative 
        easier way to submit additions on a title by title basis. There are no special 
        formats to learn, you just request a template for a movie, fill in any missing 
        data and send it back to the mail-server. For information on this interface 
        send a message with the subject:

          HELP UPDATE

        to <mail-server@imdb.com> or for receive a template for a movie directly use
        the subject:

          TEMPL TITLE <title>

        For example:

          TEMPL TITLE Vertigo (1958)
          TEMPL TITLE Lion King, The (1994)

        The "UPDATE" interface now includes support for adding to the filmography and
        biography sections in a similar manner. The subject to use is:

          TEMPL NAME <surname>, <first name>

        For example:

          TEMPL NAME Grant, Cary
          TEMPL NAME Davis, Geena

        h4. Taking Part in the Movie Ratings Poll

        Everyone is encouraged to take part in the movie ratings poll (see Q 11). The
        WWW interface provides a simple way to vote in the report - just look up
        the details on any title and the voting buttons are located at the bottom
        of the page. You must remember to mail your votes to the ratings tabulator if
        you vote via this interface (the voting page has full details of what to do).

        Another way to vote is by replying to the weekly movie ratings ballot article
        posted to rec.arts.movies.lists+surveys every Friday. The WWW interface also 
        contains a link to the weekly ballot:

          http://us.imdb.com/Ballot/

        Finally, a selection of movie ratings ballots are now available via the movie
        mail-server interface. For more information send e-mail with the subject:

          HELP BALOT

        to <mail-server@imdb.com>.

        The poll is one of the largest on-going polls on the Internet. As of October
        1997 there have been over 2,100,000 votes by 400,000 people for over 40,000
        movies.


        h4. How to get a review included in the WWW interface

        Other than archiving reviews sent to the moderated rec.arts.movies.reviews
        USENET newsgroup, we don't store movie reviews in the database directly,
        instead they are linked via URLs from other sources on the Internet. If
        you do not have access to your own www page(s) to publish your reviews,
        then read rec.arts.movies.reviews for a week or so before posting your
        review there - it will then be archived in HTML format by us, usually within
        two weeks.

        
      usage:

        9. Key to the titles
        ====================

        The titles in the database fall into one of five categories:

         (1) movies, unless otherwise indicated the title is a movie
         (2) made for TV movies, indicated by a (TV) tag
         (3) made for video movies, indicated by a (V) tag
         (4) TV-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s
         (5) mini-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s and a (mini) tag


        10. Key to the symbols appearing in filmographies
        =================================================

        The filmography databases enable notes on a particular performance/contribution
        to be recorded. Each database has a different set of symbols, although some 
        overlap where appropriate. 


        Universal Symbols
        -----------------
        (uncredited)  = the person was not credited on screen for their contribution


        Writers Key
        -----------
        (song)        =  The writer is the author (composer?) of a song on
                         which the screenplay was based.
        (desc)       =  The writer contributed on the desc for the
                         screenplay only or the writer is the author of a
                         desc on which the movie was based.
        (play)        =  The writer is the author of the play on which the
                         screenplay was based.
        (novel)       =  The writer is the author of the novel on which the
                         screenplay was based.
        (novel XXX)   =  The writer is the author of the novel on which the
                         screenplay was based, but the novel is not the same
                         title as the movie.
        (book)        =  The writer is the author of the book on which the
                         screenplay was based.
        (article)     =  The writer is the author of the article on which the
                         screenplay was based.
        (operetta)    =  The writer is the author of the operetta on which the
                         screenplay was based.
        (also XXX)    =  The writer was involved in some other aspect than just
                         writing the screenplay.  They may have authored the novel
                         the screenplay was based on, or developed the desc, etc.

        Composers Key
        -------------
        (songs)       = The composer composed songs for the movie
        (also songs)  = The composer composed also songs for the movie


        11. Key to movie ratings
        ========================

        The movie ratings report is a massive on-going poll of movies rated on a scale
        from 1 (bad) to 10 (excellent) by users on the Internet. An example entry on
        the report is:

              0000000115    3314   8.8  Casablanca (1942)

        For each movie, the vote distribution, the total number of votes and the 
        average rating are shown. The vote distribution uses a single character to 
        represent the percentage of votes for each ranking.  The following characters
        codes can appear:

             "." no votes cast        "3" 30-39% of the votes  "7" 70-79% of the votes
             "0"  1-9%  of the votes  "4" 40-49% of the votes  "8" 80-89% of the votes
             "1" 10-19% of the votes  "5" 50-59% of the votes  "9" 90-99% of the votes
             "2" 20-29% of the votes  "6" 60-69% of the votes  "*" 100%   of the votes

        So, in our example above, "Casablanca" has received a total of 3314 votes, the
        average of the votes being 8.8 with 50-59% 10/10; 10-19% 9/10; 10-19% 8/10; 
        1-9% 7/10 etc.


        12. Appearances in TV-series before an actor was even born!
        ===========================================================

        There are several TV-series which have been running for many years, for 
        example "As the World Turns" started in 1956 and "The Doctors" in 1963. 
        Several actors and actresses began their careers by appearing in series such
        as these, for example, Meg Ryan played Betsy Montgomery in "As the World 
        Turns". 

        Lists of movies (filmographies) are usually sorted into chronological order,
        the year used being the year that the movie was released, or in the case of
        long running TV-series, the year it was first broadcast. This means that you
        can sometimes get information indicating a particular performer appeared in a 
        TV-series before they were even born. In our example, Meg Ryan was born in 
        1961, but her filmography indicates she appeared in "As the World Turns" in 
        1956! 

        To reduce confusion, we normally use the character name to indicate the
        range of years the people appeared in the show. In our example
        Ryan's appearance was from 1982 to 1984 so her character name becomes 
        "Betsy Montgomery (1982-1984)",


        13. What do the (I), (II) etc. mean in some names?
        ==================================================

        There are two types of Roman numerals appearing in our names. Here's
        an example of the first type:

        Ahern II, Lloyd

        Lloyd Ahern II is a cinematographer that has the same name as his
        father Lloyd Ahern except for the "II" used to distinguish between
        them. The Roman numeral is directly and officially part of the name
        and not in any parentheses. It is used in actual credits of movies and
        in other information sources that have data on this man.

        The reason is simply to make clear that you are talking about the son 
        and not the father. The two are likely to be mixed up since they are
        both cinematographers. Although someone familiar with their
        biographical data might conclude from the context if the father or the
        son was involved in a particular movie, it's nonetheless convenient to
        have the Roman numeral to remove ambiguity.                          

        The second type of Roman numeral appearing in names is very similar,
        although there is a crucial difference. Again the Roman numeral is
        added to distinguish between two or more different people that share a
        name but are not identical. But this time the number is not part of
        the official name of a person as used in credits or other information
        sources. It's a number added by IMDb and it's always within        
        parentheses, for example:

           John Smith (I)

        The need for these numbers arose naturally as the database grew over
        time and more and more name clashes occurred with the consequence that
        credits belonging to one person were also showing up for all others
        with the same name. Generally, the more common a name is the more
        likely there will be mix-ups and the more Roman numerals have to be
        added. As an example look up John Taylor for which we already store 15
        (!) variants not counting cases with initials.                      

        There are no strict rules as to which person gets which number        
        although we try to give more important or famous people lower numbers 
        (and big stars none at all for the time being) and also people that  
        came chronologically before other people. Also, if a person has been
        billed with different names, one of them being more distinctive than
        the others (due to an added initial, for example), we tend to use the
        unique name that needs no Roman numeral as the primary name and add   
        the name with the Roman numeral as an alternative name.            

        The need for Roman numerals follows from the basic database design.
        The names and titles themselves are the keys into the data and must be
        unique, hence the need for Roman numerals. Other solutions are
        possible, but we feel that the current solution is the best for the 
        time being and hope this view is also shared by our users.
