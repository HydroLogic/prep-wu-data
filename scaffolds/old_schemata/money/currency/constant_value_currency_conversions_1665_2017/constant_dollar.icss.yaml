      Conversion factors for years prior to 1913 are re-based from data in John J. McCusker, "How Much Is That in Real Money?," (The McCusker data use 1860 as the base year, with 1860 = 1.00. To produce conversion factors for 1665-1912, the McCusker data are re-based, as indicated at the top of each CF column.)

       To convert dollars of any year 1665 to estimated 2017 to dollars of the base year (CPI [1982-84], 2005, or other years, DIVIDE
       that year's dollar amount by the conversion factor (CF) for that base year, rounded to no more than four decimal places (more cautious:
       prior to 1913 round to 2 decimal places; for 1913 and later round to 3 decimal places).
       
       h3. Data Quality Notes
       
       Data prior to 1913 are estimates; data for 1913 to the present involve data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though the specific methods
       of data collection have changed during that period.  Use special caution concerning data prior to 1913.
    
       
       It is strongly recommended that all dollar figures using these conversion factors for years prior to 1913 be rounded to no more than three
       significant digits, e.g., $14,663 becomes $14,700, and preferably—especially for early years—to two digits, that is, to $15,000.  Similarly,
       dollars derived for years 1913 to the present should be rounded to no more than three significant digits, that is, $14,660.
       
       Suggestion:  Use (final) 2006 conversion factors instead of estimated 2007 conversion factors unless 2007 data are required.  If precise
       comparison is needed of dollar figures for years starting with 1947, use CPI-U-X1 or CPI-U-RS conversion factors.  (See notes at the
       bottom of the table.)
       
       _(The following examples round to THREE SIGNIFICANT DIGITS, e.g., $3378 becomes $3380)_
       
           For example, to convert $1000 dollars of 1960 to dollars of CPI (1982-84):  $1000/0.296 = $3380 (rounded to three digits)
              Dollars of 1995:  $1000/0.194=$5150; 1996:  $1000/0.189=$5290; 1997:  $1000/0.184=$5430
              Dollars of 1998:  $1000/0.182=$5490; 1999:  $1000/0.178=$5620; 2000:  $1000/0.172=$5810
              Dollars of 2001:  $1000/0.167=$5990;  2002:  $1000/0.165=$6060
              Dollars of 2003:  $1000/0.161=$6210; 2004:  $1000/0.157=$6370; 2005:  $1000/0.152=$6580
              Dollars of estimated 2006:  $1000/0.147=$6800; CPI-U-X1 (2005$):  $1000/0.165=$6060
              Dollars of estimated CPI-U-RS (experimental measure; 2005$):  $1000/0.179=$5590
              Reminder:  All these have been rounded to three significant digits, e.g., $5586.50 becomes $5590.
           Prior to 1913, suggest rounding to two digits, e.g., $1000 dollars in 1960 become $22,000 2005 dollars ($1000/0.045)
           
       Note: To reverse the process, for example, to determine what a year 2005-dollar amount would be in dollars of another year, simply multiply the year 2005 amount by the
       conversion factor of that year.  For example, $1000 2005 dollars would equal in value about $74 in dollars of 1940 ($1000 x 0.072 = $72), again suggest rounding to 2
       (before 1913) or 3 (starting 1913) decimal places.  Two columns provide conversion factors for 2005 for the CPI-U-X1 and CPI-U-RS series.  CPI-U-X1 applies the inflation
       measure introduced in 1983 to the period 1950 to 1982.  CPI-U-RS is an experimental series, with 1977 = 100, re-based here to 2005 = 1.000.  CPI-U-RS often results in lower
       measured inflation than either the CPI-U or the CPI-U-X1 series (see inflation-rate columns).
           
       Conversion factors are stated so that the conversion year = 1.000 instead of 100.0, to ease CF arithmetic calculations.  Reminder: If precise comparisons are needed for the
       period 1950 (or 1947) through the present, use CPI-U-X1 or CPI-U-RS.  Inflation assumptions: Inflation conversion factors for 2007 and later years, assume, as of early
       2007; 2.1 percent in 2007; 2.2 percent in 2008 through 2017; 2006-2012 are the average of OMB and CBO inflation estimates for each year as of early 2006; 2013-2017 are only
       from CBO because OMB did not project past 2012 in its 2007 Budget proposals.  These will be updated February 2008.  Conversion factors are calculated using McCusker data
       for years to 1912, using 1982 CPI = 11.54 in 1860 dollars.  (The source of "McCusker data" is identified at the bottom of this table.)  Conversion factors for years
       starting 1913 use the CPI-U as the base, from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Monthly and annual CPI data are available at the BLS web site:
       http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm#data (CPI-U = all urban consumers).  The conversion factor data used from McCusker and CPI for each year are shown above each CF column.
           
       h3. Usage
    
       Note: 2006 CPI estimated February 2006 was 201.5; actual (final) was 201.6.  Both of these round to 3.2 percent inflation.  So the final conversion factors differ
       insignificantly from those estimated early in 2006, based on the average of OMB and CBO inflation estimates for 2006.  Conversion factors for years prior to 1913 are
       re-based from data in John J. McCusker, "How Much Is That in Real Money?," Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society (2001), Table A-1, Column 6.  (The McCusker data
       use 1860 as the base year, with 1860 = 1.00. To produce conversion factors for 1665-1912, the McCusker data are re-based, as indicated at the top of each CF column.)
       Earlier versions of these conversion factors used pre-1913 CPI data for 1800 to 1912 CPI from Historical Statistics of the United States (USGPO, 1975), Series E 135, Vol I,
       pp 210-211 (1967 base) re-based to 1982-84 using 1967 = 0.334 in 1982-84 CPI-U base.  For reference, the earlier data, from Historical Statistics, are included as a column
       here, though the earlier data are no longer used to produce these conversion factors.  Data for years prior to 1913 should be considered estimates.
           
       CPI is CPI-U, the broader measure for all urban consumers, using year-to-year averages, not December to December.  When careful comparison of dollar figures for the period since 1950 is required, the CPI-U-RS series or the CPI-U-X1 series should be used, which applies the post-1982 CPI to the period 1950 to 1982.
           
       Conversion factors for the experimental CPI [CPI-U-RS] are supplied for the years starting 1947.   It can be used in place of CPI-U-X1 for careful comparison over years starting in 1947.  However, there are limits as well as strengths to this experimental measure (see link below for additional information).
           
           CPI conversion factors use CPI data, stated as 1982-84 = 1.000.
           1995 conversion factors are re-based from CPI using 1995 average (152.4)
           1996 conversion factors are re-based from CPI using 1996 average (156.9)
           1997 conversion factors are re-based from CPI using 1997 average (160.5)
           1998 conversion factors use the final 1998 CPI of 163.0; estimated 1998 CF assumed 164.0.
           1999 conversion factors use the final 1999 CPI of 166.6; estimated 1999 CF assumed 167.0.
           2000 conversion factors use the final 2000 CPI of 1.722; estimated 2000 CF [early 2000] assumed 1.7085.
           2001 conversion factors use the final 2001 CPI of 1.771; estimated 2001 CF [early 2001] assumed 1.765.
           2002 conversion factors use the final 2002 CPI of 1.799; estimated 2002 CF [early  2002] assumed 1.803 (inflation of 1.8%).
           2003 conversion factors use the final 2003 CPI of 1.840; estimated 2003 CF [early 2003] assumed CPI of 1.839 (inflation of 2.25%).
           2004 conversion factors use the final 2004 CPI of 1.889; estimated 2004 CF [early 2004] assumed CPI of 1.868 (inflation of 1.5%).
           2005 conversion factors use the final 2005 CPI of 1.953; estimated 2005 CF [early 2005] assumed CPI of 1.934 (inflation of 2.4%).
           2006 conversion factors use the final 2006 CPI of 2.016; estimated 2006 CF [early 2006] assumed CPI of 2.105; both estimate and final round to 3.2% inflation.
           2007 estimated conversion factors use the final 2006 CPI of 2.016 and assume 2.1 percent inflation in 2007, an estimated CPI of 2.058.
           The 2007 to 2017 conversion factors assume inflation rates indicated at the top of this page, averaged from estimates by the Office of Management and
           Budget (to 2012 only) and/or Congressional Budget Office (all years), as of January and February 2007.
           
       h3. Data Quality 
       
       Points of Caution:
               
       # Data for years prior to 1913 are estimates and should be considered approximations.        
       # Year 2006 conversion factors are based on early 2006 inflation estimates by the OMB and the Congressional Budget Office.  These will be revised in early 2007 with final
       2006 CPI data.        
       # The CPI is changed periodically, so data for the entire series are not precisely comparable.  See the discussion in Historical Statistics (1975), Volume I, pages 190 to
       192.  The major CPI change in 1983 effectively reduced the measured CPI by changing the way home ownership costs are measured.  To apply the CPI used starting 1983 to years
       1950 to 1982, use the CPI-U-X1 series, as shown above, from The Economic Report of the President 2006, Tables B-60 to B-62, and tables in earlier editions of Economic
       Report of the President.  By definition, CPI-U-X1 is the same as CPI starting 1983.        
       # All CPI conversion factors are based on year-to-year averages, not December to December changes.        
       Detailed explanations of the CPI are available at the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI web site: http://stats.bls.gov/cpihome.htm.  Discussion of the CPI-U-RS and its
       strengths and limits can be found at http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpirsdc.htm and at the Census Bureau site, http://www.census.gov/hhes/income/income00/cpiurstxt.html.  The
       CPI-U-RS data are from the Census Bureau, which uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics' experimental Consumer Price Index (CPI-U-RS) starting 1977.  The Census Bureau derived
       the CPI-U-RS for years before 1977 by applying the 1977 CPI-U-RS-to-CPI-U ratio to the 1947 to 1976 CPI-U.  The 1978 through 2005 CPI-U-RS data are from Economic Report of
       the President 2006, Table B-62, page 354.

       Notes:
       * CF for pre-1913 were produced by re-basing McCusker data using 1982 as the bridge year.  Then those conversion columns were copied to the
       appropriate CF column, using the equal and round functions, rounded to 3 or 4 places.  Then columns were copied and "paste special" values only back
       onto themselves.  The values displayed may be one less decimal place than the values stored.
       * The early 2006 estimate of that year's CPI was 2.015, for 2006 inflation of 3.17 percent; actual CPI was 2.016, for 2006 inflation of 3.23 percent.
       * Both round to 3.2 percent.  So the early 2006 estimate of 2006 inflation differs insignificantly from final 2006 inflation.
           
       h3. Revisions
       
       * Revised to 2006 January 18, 2007, using final 2006 inflation of 3.2 percent, CPI = 201.6.
           
       * Revised for 2006 and later years March 10, 2006, using the average of OMB and CBO inflation estimates for those years.
           
       * Also uses revised (2001) McCusker data.
