            Engineering Technical Data Reference Tables
            
            This page provides a listing of engineering reference data that is commonly found in
            reference books. As a mechanical engineer, I have found that the World Wide Web is a
            wonderful way to communicate standards to many people in a way that can be efficient and
            valuable. I am attempting to start something good with this page and look forward to your
            comments. Additional links to web pages of interest to engineers preceed the data table
            links.

            **Please Note**:
                
            This data must be used with proper dilligence and care. Verification of results by
            independent means is essential for any design that can imperil life or property using the
            information provided in this database. Liability for damages resulting from activities
            using this data rest completely with the user who assumes all risk.
