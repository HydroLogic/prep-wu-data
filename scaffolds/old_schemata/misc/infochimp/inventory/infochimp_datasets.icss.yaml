  - desc: "'Consensus rating, from 1 to 5, of a dataset, with '3' representing an average-interest dataset and '5' an excellent one.  The rating is a true Bayesian estimate: a dataset with two '5' votes, say, may be outranked by a dataset with 73 votes averaging 4.7.  The former has much statistical uncertainty and so we adjust it strongly towards the mean. The latter dataset has been widely accorded a high rating, and so it receives a very small depreciation.'\n        "
