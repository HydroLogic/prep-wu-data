       This file gives the name, location, and data inventory for all the
       weather stations in the <abbr title="US National Climactic Data Center">NCDC</abbr>
       Integrated Surface Database (Global Hourly) weather datasets.
    
       h2. Important Note on Redistribution:
    
           The non-U.S. data (ie, data for other countries) within this
           database are subject to WMO Resolution 40 restrictions, and cannot
           be redistributed within or outside of the U.S. for any commercial
           activities.  See **Rights & Restrictions** below.
    
       h2. About the Integrated Surface Database
    
       The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists of global hourly and
       synoptic observations compiled from numerous sources, into a single
       common ASCII format and common data model. ISD was developed as a joint
       activity within Asheville's Federal Climate Complex. The National
       Climatic Data Center, with U.S. Air Force and Navy partners, began the
       effort in 1998 with the assistance of external funding from several
       sources. ISD integrates data from over 100 original data sources,
       including numerous data formats which were key-entered from paper forms
       during the 1950's-1970's timeframe. ISD Version 1 was released in 2001,
       with Version 2 (additional quality control applied) in 2003. Since 2003,
       there have been continued incremental improvements in automated quality
       control software.
    
       The database comprises over 20,000 stations worldwide, with some having
       data as far back as 1901, though the data show a substantial increase in
       volume in the 1940's and again in the early 1970's. Currently there are
       over 11,000 stations "active" and updated daily in the database. Total
       data volume (uncompressed) is over 350 gigabytes. ISD includes numerous
       parameters such as wind speed and direction, wind gust, temperature, dew
       point, cloud data, sea level pressure, altimeter setting, station
       pressure, present weather, visibility, precipitation amounts for various
       time periods, snow depth, and various other elements as observed by each
       station.
