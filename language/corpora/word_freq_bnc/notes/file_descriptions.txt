Word 	= Word type (headword followed by any variant forms) - see pp.4-5
PoS  	= Part of speech (grammatical word class - see pp. 12-13)
Fr 	= Rounded frequency per million word tokens (down to a minimum of 10 occurrences of a lemma per million)- see pp. 5
Ra   	= Range: number of sectors of the corpus (out of a maximum of 100) in which the word occurs
Di 	= Dispersion value (Juilland's D) from a minimum of 0.00 to a maximum of 1.00.

FrSp    = Frequency (per million words) in spoken texts of the BNC
RaSp    = Range across spoken texts (up to a maximum of 10 sectors of the corpus)
DiSp    = Dispersion in spoken texts: a value from 0 to 1 (Juilland's D)
LLSpWr  = Log Likelihood score, indicating distinctiveness, or significance of the difference between the spoken and written language frequencies
FrWr    = Frequency (per million words) in written texts
RaWr    = Range across written texts (up to a maximum of 90 sectors of the corpus)
DiWr    = Dispersion in written texts, a value from 0 to 1 (Juilland's D)
