Leipzig Corpora Collection Download Page
The Leipzig Corpora Collection presents corpora in different languages using the same format and comparable sources. The corpora are ready to use with the Corpus Browser.
Moreover, all data are available as plain text and as MySQL database tables for various applications. They are intended both for scientific use by the corpus linguist as well as for applications such as knowledge extraction programs.
The corpora are identical in format and similar in size and content. They contain randomly selected sentences in the language of the corpus and are available in sizes of 100,000 sentences, 300,000 sentences, 1 million sentences etc..
The sources are either newspaper texts or texts randomly collected from the web. The texts are split into sentences.
Non-sentences and foreign language material was removed. Because the information which words co-occur with each other is useful for many applications, these data ware precomputed and included as well.
For each word, the most significant words appearing 
as immediate left neighbor
as immediate right neighbor
anywhere within the same sentence
are given.
The quality of such co-occurrence increases with the corpus size, so we refer to forthcoming larger corpora.
