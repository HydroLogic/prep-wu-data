Before endorsing Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the last time time the New York Daily News endorsed a Democrat was Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1940.

The San Francisco Examiner, likewise, broke 20 years of presidential Republicanism to back Clinton.

They exemplified newspapers' strong-and highly unusual-leaning to the Democratic candidate this year.


As it turned out, newspapers pretty fairly reflected the mood of voters, who turned President George Bush out of office by a wide margin and ended a 12-year Republican lock on the White House.

According to late responses to E&P's Quadrennial Poll of presidential endorsements and to information gathered independently, Clinton accelerated his lead in endorsements in the week before Election Day.

A final tally gave Clinton 183 daily newspaper endorsements, reflecting combined circulation of 17.5 million, to Bush's 138 endorsements from papers with total circulation of 9.9 million. Four papers, including the 180, 216-circulation Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald-American, endorsed independent candidate Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire.

E&P originally reported (Oct. 24, P. 9) Clinton with 149 endorsements, Bush with 121 and Perot with one. The latest count included 880 papers.

The majority of papers-predominantly small and medium in size but including two of the biggest, USA Today and the Wall Street Journal-made no endorsement. Those failing to endorse numbered 559 papers representing over 22.9 million circulation.

Though weeklies are not included in the poll, it is worth noting that the York County Coast Star, the 12,900-circulation local weekly in Bush's vacation hometown of Kennebunkport, Maine, broke 20 years of presidential neutrality and endorsed Clinton. Likewise, the nation's largest alternative weekly, the Village Voice of New York, backed Clinton.
