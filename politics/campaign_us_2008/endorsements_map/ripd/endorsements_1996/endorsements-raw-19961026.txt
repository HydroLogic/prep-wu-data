# To endorse, or not. Editor & Publisher, 0013094X, 10/26/96, Vol. 129, Issue 43

As our reporter notes in a story (p. 12) this week on E&P's quadrennial
presidential poll, the editorial voices of American newspapers "are developing a
severe case of laryngitis . . . when it comes to endorsing a presidential
candidate."

Our latest poll shows that nearly seven out of every 10 papers responding said
they were undecided about the candidates or were adhering to a "no-endorsement"
policy. This is an increase from 67% of the sample four years ago. Nearly 30% of
the the papers polled cite a "no-endorsement" policy. This steady movement away
from presidential endorsements has been noticeable since 1940 when only 13.4% of
the newspapers remained neutral.

Some editors of nonmetropolitan newspapers feel that they should confine their
endorsements to candidates for local offices and leave presidential endorsements
up to the larger metropolitan papers. We can't see the difference. In spite of
the proliferation of information sources, it seems to us that editors are in a
better position to reach decisions -- and to make recommendations -- about
candidates, whether local or national, than the average reader is.

If there is any validity to that view, then editors should feel it's their
responsibility to speak their minds. But some of them just don't want to. As one
of them said: "It's a good debate, but we don't want to join the fray."

The end result of this attitude of not wanting to be involved leaves the major
political campaign in the country largely up to the hucksters writing the
pitches for print and broadcast political advertising, which isn't known for
fairness, and to the talk show hosts who demonstrate no restraint about their
political leanings. It amounts to an abdication of a responsibility that
historically has rested on the shoulders of editors -- and should remain there.

CORRECTIONS

In E&P'S Quadrennial Presidential Poll (Oct. 26, p. 7), the Cullman (Ala.) Times
was listed as endorsing President Clinton for re-election. The listing was based
on a response sent by the newspaper to an E&P inquiry. In fact, the newspaper
endorsed Bob Dole.

Section: Quadrennial Presidential Poll

E&P poll finds majority of newspapers that endorse back the Republican -- for Clinton a reversal from '92

Bob Dole won a solid victory in E&P's quadrennial poll of newspaper endorsements by a margin of almost two-to-one.

Out of 179 daily newspapers endorsing a presidential hopeful, Dole earned the support of 111 papers, President Bill Clinton garnered 65 endorsements, and Libertarian Party candidate Harry Brown won one endorsement. Two other papers did not name their choice.

Dole won more newspapers, and when you add up their circulations, Dole outnumbered Clinton in terms of readers reached by the endorsements. The combined circulation of responding newspapers supporting Dole is 4,741,645, or 13.3%, compared with 4,581,337, or 12.9%, for Clinton.

Out of the total 594 poll participants, 415 newspapers, or 69.9%, had not yet made an endorsement or had a policy of not endorsing. Together, those papers represent a circulation of 26.1 million, or 73.7% of the sampling.

Of those uncommitted, 166, or 27.8% of the poll, embraced a no-endorsement policy, for a total circulation of nearly 7 million.

The growing no-endorsement policy mirrors a trend of declining voter participation in national elections.

Participants in E&P's poll responded by postcard and in phone interviews. The total number of participants account for about a third of the nation's 1,533 dailies, according to the Editor & Publisher International Year Book 1996.

The support for Dole signals that newspapers have reverted to a time-honored practice of overwhelmingly supporting Republicans for the White House.That pattern was broken only twice since the poll began in 1940 --in 1964, when more newspapers supported Barry Goldwater over Lyndon Johnson, and in 1992, when Clinton got more endorsements than George Bush.

From a publisher's perspective, Dole wins hands down. Where the boss of the business side made the endorsement decision, Dole won 66 times, to Clinton's 20.

But where editorial boards collectively chose a candidate, the race was closer, with 40 endorsements for Dole, to 38 for Clinton.

Among individual editors responsible for endorsements, Dole was the favorite of 27, compared to Clinton's 14.

Three papers in the poll endorsed Clinton in 1992, but opted for the Republican this year. They cited deep concern over ethical questions dogging the current administration, along with the White House's lack of focus regarding important policy decisions.

As Andrew Reynolds, editor of the 53,635-circulation Delaware County Daily Times in Primos, Pa., put it, "We didn't realize Clinton was such a sleaze-ball when we endorsed him four years ago."

Reynold said in his Sept. 25 editorial. "More social programs. That's exactly what this country needs. More handouts to more freeloaders. A foreign policy that's an allen concept to the White House. Token interest in national security. . . . That's what four years of Bill Clinton has wrought. That's the foundation upon which four more years of Bill Clinton will build."

Similarily, Tom Bell, editor and publisher of the 4,600-circulation Chanute (Kan.) Tribune, expressed disappointment with Clinton's record after four years in the White House.

"I endorsed Clinton in 1992 largely because I thought Bush was ineffective, and Clinton gave us hope," Bell said. "Our biggest problem with Clinton now is that he can't be trusted, and I don't think his word is good. . . . Bottom line, Dole is the lesser of two evils. At least with Dole you know what you're getting, and I know he's good for his word."

Dole also seems to benefit from favorite son status in his home state. The 7,645-circulation Newton (Kan.) Kansan picked Clinton four years ago, but supports Dole now.

"We have a keen interest in Bob Dole's career, and that may have as much to do with it as anything else," said publisher Douglas Anstaett. "But, also the character issue is a major concern to me, making promises and not fulfilling them, the flip-flopping and the poll watching. There is a cloud of scandal hanging over the administration.

"In Dole's case, he's had the hatchet-man label in the past, but both Republicans and Democrats in Washington believe that when he says he will do something, they believe it," Anstaett added.

Only one paper in this year's poll picked Clinton after supporting the Republican in 1992, and the reversal largely results from a management change.

Mark Contreras, who has been publisher of the Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Times Leader for about 18 months, said, "I'm not a bug-eyed zealot for Cinton, but I've lived in Kansas for six years, and I was underwhelmed before [with Dole] and I've continued to be underwhelmed as the campaign has progressed."

Both Dole and Clinton won endorsements from their "hometown" newspapers.

Alan B. Evans, the publisher of the Russell (Kan.) Daily News who has known Dole since 1950, says he has full confidence in his former Kiwanis Club colleague.

"We endorsed Bob Dole because he is an honorable person, and if there is any such thing as an honorable politician, he's it," Evans said. "We are very, very proud of him in Russell. We argue editorially with him sometimes, but he is a very fine, capable and intelligent individual."

In Arkansas, the Hope Star re-endorsed Clinton.

"Being partial, it's his hometown, and we wouldn't be behind anyone else," said publisher Ronnie Cupstid. "President Clinton is good for Hope. Why put someone else in there who we don't know anything about? The economy is doing well and Clinton's done a good job."

In a few cities where newspapers compete, editorial endorsements split accordingly.

In the Windy City, the Chicago Sun-Times endorsed Clinton, and the Chicago Tribune backed Dole. In Atlanta, even though Cox Enterprises owns both papers, in accordance with editorial traditions, the Journal was expected to endorse Dole while the Constitution goes for Clinton.

In other two-newspaper towns, both went the same way. In the City of Brotherly Love, for instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News both support Clinton. Likewise, the Kingsport, Tenn., Daily News and Times-News support Dole

Additionally, the Las Vegas Sun picked Clinton, as did the Newark Star-Ledger, and the Detroit Free Press.

A lot of the larger papers had not made a choice as E&P went to press.

ABOUT THE POLL

E&P'S quadrennial presidential poll follows a tradition dating from 1940.

This year, postcards were mailed to all 1,533 U.S. dailies in September. Newspapers indicated whether they planned a presidential endorsement, who makes the decision, and whom they planned to support. Some papers that didn't respond to two mailings were contacted by phone.

By the time we had to draw the line, the third week in October, the tally included 594 papers accounting for some 35.5 million circulation, a little over half the U.S. total. Even so, many of the major metro papers had not endorsed as we went to press.

This year, the majority of papers returned to their roots: They backed the Republican, as they have every election since 1940 but two. Also, in keeping with a long-standing trend, more newpapers than ever made no endorsement or had a policy against it.

A sampling of newspapers:


FOR BILL CLINTON:
 
"Republicans complain that Clinton has stolen many of their programs and ideas, but what Clinton has really managed to steal is the broad center of the American political spectrum -- a position we hope he will keep during a second term."   The Boston Globe
 
"He has vacillated on issues large and small, and at times he has conducted himself like a man with something to hide. Nevertheless, we think he is still a better choice than Bob Dole."   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch
 
"Although we believe former Senator Bob Dole is a man of better character, we prefer the vision espoused by President Bill Clinton."   The Chicago Sun-Times
 
"The quietness of this campaign may be troubling proof that the public is alienated and apathetic. Or it may be a sign that most Americans think the guy who's been in charge for the past four years is doing quite well, thank you. And he has."   The Philadelphia Inquirer
 
"The President has tried to appeal to a diverse nation while Mr. Dole has succumbed to the wishes of those who for the moment dominate his party -- the narrow-minded hard right whose exclusionist agenda would punish Americans who disagree with them on politics, economics and life style."   The Hartford Courant
 
Some others endorsing Mr. Clinton:
 
The Asbury Park Press, Neptune, N.J.
The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson
The Atlanta Constitution
The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.
The Concord Monitor, N.H.
The Courier-News, Bridgewater, N.J.

FOR BOB DOLE:
 
Bob Dole has "proven himself a man of healthy conscience and wise pragmatism, of grit and mettle under fire and -- most important -- a man who is true to his word."   The Chicago Tribune
 
"Mr. Dole also would provide a steadier hand at the foreign policy helm. He knows what it means to send American troops into battle. And once there, he would make sure they were allowed to do the job properly."   The Detroit News
 
"In this election year, character is not merely one of several issues demanding our attention. It is the only issue. That makes our decision easier. Bob Dole has character, Bill Clinton has none. So Bob Dole is our choice."   New York Observer
 
"Four years ago, this newspaper endorsed Bill Clinton for President. We're not going to do so again. We're opting for substance over style this time. We're opting for a candidate who will sign legilation cutting spending, taxes and regulations, insted of one who just says with a wink and a nod that he's for reform and then fights it."   The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash.
 
"Mr. Dole's reputation derives, first of all, from the fact that in Washington, a city not known chiefly for honesty and integrity, he has always been a man of his word. Mr. Dole has been called a pragmatist. He is certainly no ideologue. His strengths are in the art of practical politics, of getting the votes together to get things done."   The Washington Times
